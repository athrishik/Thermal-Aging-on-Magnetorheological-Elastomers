# Thermal-Aging-on-Magnetorheological-Elastomers
This study examines how humidity-induced aging affects silicone-based magnetorheological elastomers. Free vibration tests showed that damping ratio and natural frequency changed with humidity exposure due to moisture-driven alterations in particle interactions and matrix properties.


This study took place at Manipal Institute of Technology, Udupi, Karnataka, India. It began January 2023 and was completed in May 2023.

It was done by Hrishik Kunduru, Abhinandan Kausthab, Krutika Tandel.
